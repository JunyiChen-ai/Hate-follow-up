"""Pro-Cap V3 — Multimodal_Data port (caption + label entries +
in-context demo prompt builder).

Source: `external_repos/procap/codes/scr/dataset.py:49-294` (class
`Multimodal_Data`). The ported pieces are:

  * `load_pkl` — reads our Qwen2-VL caption pkl
    (`results/procap_v3/<dataset>/captions_<split>.pkl`)
  * Caption stitching: 8 VQA probe answers + general caption joined
    with `' . '` into a single `cap` string. Mirrors upstream's
    `cap=cap+' . '+ext` accumulation in `dataset.py:153-159`. Probe
    order matches upstream `--ASK_CAP race,gender,country,animal,
    valid_disable,religion` (`scr/config.py:43`) plus `person`,
    `what_animal`, and the gen caption for completeness — same
    fields the V3 captioner produces.
  * `select_context` — upstream `dataset.py:205-236` verbatim, picks
    one positive + one negative random demo from the train pool
    (`max_demo_per_label = 1`).
  * `process_prompt` — upstream `dataset.py:238-254` verbatim. Builds
    `<sent> . It was <mask> . <cap>` for the query and
    `<sent> . It was <label_word> . <cap>` for the demo, joined with
    ` . </s> `.

Key adaptations vs. upstream:

  1. **Video instead of meme**: `meme_text` → video transcript field
     (truncated to 500 chars, matching the LoReHM brief). The label
     mapping `{0: POS_WORD='good', 1: NEG_WORD='bad'}` is unchanged
     (`config.py:21-22`).
  2. **Train/valid/test splits** come from our
     `<dataset_root>/splits/{split}_clean.csv` instead of upstream's
     `domain_splits/<dataset>_<mode>.json`. Validation split is a
     deterministic 80/20 stratified split from the train pool
     (seed=2025 by default).
  3. **No `ADD_ENT` / `ADD_DEM`** — those upstream features pull
     external entity / demographic info we don't have for video.
     Disabled by default; the architecture is otherwise identical.
