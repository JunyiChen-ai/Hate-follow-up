"""MATCH-HVD — intermediate label-free preview of the judgement output.

**Status note (2026-04-15 scope correction)**: MATCH-HVD is a
supervised method. Its authoritative baseline number comes from
**stage 3** — a classifier head trained on MFCC audio features +
ViViT video features + BERT text features (the judgement summary).
Stage 3 lives in a separate brief; this file is NOT the primary
MATCH deliverable.

What this file is: a **debug / preview tool** that parses the stage
2c judge summary text for a yes/no verdict, so we can spot-check
whether the vLLM-substituted judge is producing sensible rationales
without running the full stage 3 training loop. It is label-free by
construction (no label data tunes the phrase list), which is why it
sits here — useful for quick sanity checks, not for the paper
headline number.

Input : `results/match_qwen2vl_7b/<dataset>/judge.json` with
        schema `[{"id": vid, "summary": "<judge text>"}]`
Output: `results/match_qwen2vl_7b/<dataset>/test_match_peek.jsonl`
        with schema `{"video_id": vid, "pred": 0|1, "summary": "<...>"}`

The file suffix was renamed from `test_match.jsonl` to
`test_match_peek.jsonl` to avoid confusion with the stage 3 output
that eval_generative_predictions.py will eventually consume. The
parser rules themselves are unchanged from the earlier deliverable
and are preserved here for reproducibility of the preview.

Parser rules (no label tuning):
  1. Scan the lowercased summary for explicit verdict phrases in
     priority order. Negative phrases ("not hateful", "non-hateful",
     "should not be classified as hateful", ...) are checked before
     positive phrases to avoid substring false-matches. First hit wins.
  2. Word-count fallback: count standalone `\\bhateful\\b` minus
     occurrences of `non-hateful` / `non hateful` / `not hateful`.
     Net > 0 → pred=1; net ≤ 0 with any non-hate marker → pred=0.
  3. Unparseable / empty → pred=0 (conservative default).
